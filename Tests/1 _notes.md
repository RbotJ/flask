Steps to Review and Validate Flask Project
Code Structure and Organization:
Ensure each module (Data Import, Indicator Calculation, etc.) is in its separate directory for clarity.
Check that your Flask routes are well defined in app.py or main.py.
Validate the use of Blueprints for larger applications for better modularity.
Code Quality:
Review the code for Python best practices – PEP8 standards, clear variable names, and comments.
Look for proper error handling and logging, especially for the parts interacting with external APIs or data sources.
Functionality of Each Module:
Test each module individually to ensure it performs its intended function correctly.
For the Data Import module, check data fetching and parsing accuracy.
For the Indicator Calculation module, validate the mathematical correctness of the algorithms.
Integration Testing:
Test how modules interact with each other, e.g., how the Data Import module feeds into the Indicator Calculation module.
Ensure the system correctly interprets and processes the data through these integrated modules.
Database and Data Handling:
If using a database, ensure your ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models are correctly set up and tested.
Check for efficient and accurate data storage and retrieval.
Front-end Interaction (if applicable):
If your project includes a front end, test the integration between the Flask backend and the front-end interface.
Ensure that API endpoints are correctly serving the data to the front-end.
Performance Testing:
Look for any performance bottlenecks, especially in data processing and strategy calculation modules.
Check the system’s response time and resource usage under different loads.
Security Review:
Ensure that there are no security vulnerabilities, particularly if dealing with sensitive financial data.
Validate the security of API endpoints, data encryption, and user authentication (if applicable).
Documentation and Comments:
Ensure that the code is well documented, which is crucial for maintenance and future development.
Review comments for clarity and relevance.
Automated Tests:
Implement unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire system.
Automated tests can help catch issues early in the development process.
Tools and Resources
Linting and Formatting Tools: Use tools like flake8 or pylint for code quality checks.
Testing Frameworks: Utilize unittest or pytest for writing and running tests.
Performance Profiling: Tools like cProfile or line_profiler can help identify performance issues.
Security Scanning: Use tools like Bandit for Python-specific security issues.
