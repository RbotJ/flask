Module Structure
Directory: indicators/
Primary Files:
__init__.py: Initializes the indicators module.
moving_average.py: Script to calculate Moving Averages.
models.py: (Optional) SQLAlchemy models specific to indicators, if needed.
utils.py: Common utility functions used in indicator calculations (e.g., data fetching).
Sample Implementation for Moving Average Calculation
Below is a basic draft for calculating a Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is just a starting point, and you should expand it with more indicators and error handling as needed.

Notes:
API Credentials: Ensure that your Alpaca API credentials (api_key, api_secret) are stored securely and not hard-coded.
Error Handling: Add robust error handling to manage API limitations, network issues, and data inconsistencies.
Database Interaction: The store_sma method is a placeholder. You'll need to define your SQLAlchemy models in models.py and implement the actual database storing logic.
Expanding Indicators: You can add more files in the indicators directory for different types of indicators, such as RSI, MACD, etc., following a similar pattern.
This draft should give you a starting point for building the Indicator Calculation module. You'll need to adjust and expand it based on your specific requirements and the full range of indicators you plan to include.
