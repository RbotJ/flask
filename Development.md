Organizing these modules in a Python Flask project requires a structured approach. Flask, being a micro web framework, is well-suited for handling the web interface and API aspects of your project. The core computational and data processing tasks can be managed by Python scripts and libraries. Here's a recommended structure:

Project Structure Overview
Application Entry Point (app.py or main.py): The main Flask application file. It initializes the Flask app and ties together the different components.
Module Directories: Each major module (Data Import, Indicator Calculation, etc.) should have its own directory containing all relevant Python scripts.
Templates Directory: For HTML templates if you're planning to have a web interface.
Static Directory: For static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
Utility Scripts: Common functions used across different modules (like data fetching, basic mathematical operations).
Configuration Files: Store configuration settings, API keys, and other constants.
Database Models (if applicable): For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to manage database interactions.
API Directory: For Flask routes that handle API requests.
Testing Directory: Contains unit tests and integration tests.
Detailed Structure
Hereâ€™s how you can structure each part:

Application Entry Point:
app.py: Initializes Flask app, registers blueprints (if used), and sets up global configurations.
Module Directories:
data_import/: Scripts for importing data from various sources.
indicators/: Calculation algorithms for different trading indicators.
strategy/: Strategy definition and management.
backtesting/: Backtesting engine implementation.
signal_generation/: Logic for signal generation based on strategies.
performance/: Performance measurement tools.
risk_management/: Risk management scripts.
ml_models/: (Optional) Machine learning models and utilities.
utilities/: Shared functions and helpers.
Templates Directory:
templates/: HTML files for rendering web pages.
Static Directory:
static/: CSS, JS, images, and other static files.
Utility Scripts:
utils/: Common utilities, helpers, and shared functions.
Configuration Files:
config.py: Configuration settings and sensitive credentials (use environment variables for sensitive data).
Database Models:
models/: Python classes for database tables if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
API Directory:
api/: Flask routes that serve as the API endpoints.
Testing Directory:
tests/: Test scripts for unit testing and integration testing.
Flask-Specific Considerations
Use Blueprints to organize your application into distinct components.
Implement RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication if you're building a web interface.
Ensure security practices in Flask, especially if handling sensitive financial data (e.g., use HTTPS, secure cookies, proper error handling).
Consider using extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask-Login for user authentication, etc.
