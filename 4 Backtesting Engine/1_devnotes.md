Overview of the Backtesting Engine Module
The Backtesting Engine module will simulate trading strategies against historical data to evaluate their performance. It will interact with your MySQL database to fetch historical data and use Alpaca API for market data where necessary.

Structure
Backtesting Engine Directory (backtesting/):
engine.py: Core backtesting logic.
models.py: SQLAlchemy models for backtesting results.
alpaca_data.py: Helper for fetching data from Alpaca API.
Database Models (models/):
Update the existing models to accommodate backtesting data storage.
Configuration File (config.py):
Add configuration settings for Alpaca API and Railway MySQL connection.
Drafting the Backtesting Engine
Backtesting Engine (backtesting/engine.py):
This script will include the logic to perform backtesting.
It should take strategy parameters, historical data, and simulate trades.
Calculate performance metrics like ROI, Sharpe Ratio, etc.
Backtesting Models (backtesting/models.py):
Define SQLAlchemy models to store backtesting results.
Include tables for storing trade history, performance metrics, etc.
Alpaca Data Fetching (backtesting/alpaca_data.py):
Implement functions to fetch historical data from Alpaca API.
Handle data normalization and error checking.
Update Database Models (models/):
Ensure your existing database models support backtesting data storage.
Configuration Settings (config.py):
Add Alpaca API keys and Railway MySQL database configurations.

Notes
Security and Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling and security measures, especially when dealing with API interactions and database operations.
Testing and Validation: Rigorously test each component to ensure accuracy and reliability, particularly for the backtesting logic.
Performance Optimization: Depending on the complexity of your strategies and the volume of data, you may need to optimize the performance of this module.
This draft serves as a starting point. You'll need to expand and tailor each part according to your specific requirements and the intricacies of your trading strategies.
