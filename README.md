## ‚ú® Features

- Python
- Flask

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Install Python requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start the server for development `python3 main.py`

## Database Schema
Setup Script
To use this script, add it to your Flask app, and run the create_schema() function when initializing your app. Make sure SQLAlchemy is installed in your environment, and the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly in Railway. This will create the necessary tables in your MySQL database upon deployment.
Database Schema

    Stocks Table

    Technical Data Table
        data_id (Primary Key)
        stock_id (Foreign Key)
        timestamp
        open_price
        high_price
        low_price
        close_price
        volume
        adjusted_close (if needed)
        granularity (to indicate if it's daily, hourly, minute-wise, etc.)

    Analyst Assessments Table
        assessment_id (Primary Key)
        stock_id (Foreign Key)
        analyst_id (if you have multiple users/analysts)
        date_of_assessment
        resistance_levels
        support_levels
        predicted_movement
        assessment_notes

    Backtesting Table
        backtest_id (Primary Key)
        assessment_id (Foreign Key)
        start_date
        end_date
        performance_metric (like % return, hit/miss on predictions, etc.)
        notes

    User Table (if you have multiple users)
        user_id (Primary Key)
        username
        email
        role

Notes:

    Normalization: Ensure that the database is normalized to avoid redundancy. For instance, the Stocks Table separates static info about each stock from their dynamic financials.
    Indexes: Create indexes on frequently queried columns (like ticker_symbol, timestamp, etc.) for faster retrieval.
    Granularity: For the Technical Data Table, consider how granular you want the data. Minute-wise data can grow large, so think about data retention policies.
    Security: Secure sensitive data, especially in the User Table.
    Flexibility: The schema allows for expansion. You can add new tables or columns as your analysis methods evolve.

This schema is a starting point and can be customized further based on your specific requirements and the features you plan to include in your app.
