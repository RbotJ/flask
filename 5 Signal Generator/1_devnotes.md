Signal Generator Module Outline
Purpose:
The Signal Generator module is responsible for analyzing market data and triggering buy or sell signals based on predefined trading strategies.

Key Components:

Signal Generation Logic:
Scripts to analyze market data and determine if the conditions of any trading strategy are met.
Should accommodate various types of signals (e.g., based on price action, technical indicators, volume changes).
Database Interaction:
Models and functions to interact with your MySQL database, handling operations like querying historical data, storing signals, and logging transactions.
Alpaca API Integration:
Functions to fetch real-time market data from Alpaca.
(Optional) Functions to execute trades on Alpaca based on generated signals.
Utilities:
Helper functions for tasks like date/time conversion, data normalization, or threshold calculations.
Testing:
Scripts to test the signal generation logic under various market scenarios.

Implementation Steps:

Implement the signal generation logic in signal_generator.py.
Define the necessary database models in models.py.
Integrate with the Alpaca API to fetch real-time data.
Develop utility functions in utils.py.
Test the module thoroughly to ensure accurate signal generation.

Additional Notes
Implement error handling, especially for API interactions and database operations.
Ensure that the system respects rate limits and data usage constraints set by Alpaca API.
The module should be scalable to handle multiple strategies and frequent data updates.
This draft provides a framework for your Signal Generator module. You can expand or modify it based on your specific trading strategies and operational requirements.
