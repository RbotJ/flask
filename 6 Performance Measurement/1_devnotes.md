Performance Measurement Module Overview
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of trading strategies by calculating key performance metrics like return on investment (ROI), win/loss ratio, drawdown, and other relevant statistics.

Key Features:

Fetch trading data and strategy results from the database.
Calculate performance metrics.
Store and retrieve performance data from the MySQL database.
Provide an API endpoint to access performance data.
Directory Structure
performance/
__init__.py
models.py - SQLAlchemy models for performance data.
performance_calculator.py - Logic for performance calculations.
performance_api.py - Flask API endpoints for the performance module.

Notes:
This is a basic draft and needs further development based on specific requirements, such as detailed performance metrics and strategies.
Ensure to handle exceptions and edge cases, especially when dealing with financial data.
Security should be a top priority, considering the sensitive nature of the data being handled.
The API should be authenticated and authorized appropriately, especially if exposed publicly.

This Blueprint will encapsulate all the Flask routes and functionality related to performance measurement, making it easy to integrate with the rest of your Flask application.

Performance Blueprint Overview
The Performance Blueprint will handle the API endpoints for fetching and displaying the performance data of your trading strategies. This includes routes for retrieving performance metrics and potentially submitting new data for calculation.

Blueprint Structure
Blueprint Initialization: Define a Blueprint for the performance module.
Routes: Define Flask routes for various performance-related operations.
Data Handling: Interact with the SQLAlchemy models and the MySQL database for data retrieval and storage.
