To set up webhooks in TradingView for your trading script, you'll need to configure TradingView alerts that send POST requests to your web server at 'finone.app'. Here's a general guide on how to do this:
Steps to Set Up Webhooks in TradingView

    Create Your Endpoint: Ensure you have an endpoint set up on your server (e.g., https://finone.app/tradingview-webhook) that can handle POST requests. This endpoint should be configured to parse the incoming data and take appropriate actions (like placing trades with your brokerage).

    Script Alert Setup in TradingView:
        Go to your TradingView chart, and open the Pine Editor.
        Write your strategy script and add conditions where you want to trigger an alert (e.g., for a buy or sell signal).
        After adding your conditions, use the alertcondition function in your script to create custom conditions for alerts.

    Create an Alert:
        On the main chart screen, click the 'Alert' icon (looks like a bell).
        Choose the condition from your script (the conditions you set with alertcondition).
        In the alert setup window, choose 'Webhook URL' as the delivery method.

    Configure the Webhook:
        Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., https://finone.app/tradingview-webhook).
        In the 'Message' field, you can format the data you want to send. This usually includes trade information like the symbol, the type of order (buy or sell), the price, etc. You can use TradingView’s placeholder variables like {{ticker}}, {{strategy.order.action}}, etc., to send dynamic data.

    Test the Alert:
        After setting it up, test the alert to ensure it's triggering correctly and that your server is receiving and processing the data as expected.

    Security Considerations:
        Ensure that your webhook endpoint is secure and can handle only authenticated and valid requests to prevent unauthorized actions.

    Rate Limits and Quotas:
        Be aware of any rate limits or quotas both on TradingView’s side and your server to avoid issues with too many requests.

Example JSON Payload for a Webhook Message

json

{
    "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
    "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
    "price": "{{strategy.order.price}}",
    "quantity": "{{strategy.order.contracts}}"
}

Important Notes

    Testing: Test thoroughly to ensure that your web server correctly handles incoming webhook requests and interacts as expected with your brokerage’s API for trade execution.
    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling on your server to deal with unexpected data or failures in API calls.
    Compliance: Ensure that your setup complies with all relevant regulations and best practices, especially if you plan to use it for live trading.

By following these steps, you can integrate your TradingView script with your web server via webhooks, enabling you to act on trading signals automatically.
